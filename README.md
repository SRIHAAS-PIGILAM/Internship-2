# Auto Insurance Claim Prediction Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Auto Insurance Claim Prediction project repository! This project was undertaken as part of the internship at Hentonic Pvt Ltd, focusing on the application of AI/ML and Data Science in predicting auto insurance claims.

## Project Details

- **Project Title:** Auto Insurance Claim Prediction
- **Intern:** P.Srihaas
- **Internship Duration:** [Start Date] - [End Date]

## Project Description

This project involved developing models for predicting auto insurance claims using machine learning, data analysis, and artificial intelligence techniques. The aim was to leverage real-world data to enhance predictive capabilities and contribute to the field of data-driven decision-making in the insurance domain.

## Folder Structure

- `code/`: Contains the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used in the project.
- `data/`: Holds datasets used for training and testing models.
- `results/`: Stores the output files, visualizations, and model evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
